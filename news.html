<h1> Version 0.2 released! </h1>
<ul>
    <li>Embedded videos (gifv, webm, youtube) don't load until the button to play them is clicked.  This means faster load time in topics with many video links.</li>
    <li>xFAQs settings page-specific code only runs on settings page: Overall page loads might speed up a little.</li>
    <li>HTML tag buttons (bold, italic, etc) now work properly in quick topic.</li>
    <li>Hotkeys for quick post/preview can now be toggled in general settings to avoid conflicts with other scripts.  They default to disabled, so be sure to go turn them on in settings if you want to use them.</li>
    <li>Account switcher link works again.</li>
</ul>
This update involved a large-scale code clean-up which will allow faster development in the future.  However, this unfortunately also provides an opportunity for accidentally breaking previously working functionality.  If something doesn't work properly / the way it used to, please come report it on <a href='http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/565885-'>Blood Money</a> so it can be fixed!
