# What is xFAQs-Next?

xFAQs-Next is a userscript to enhance the gamefaqs message boards by providing features such as rotating sigs, quick topic creation, avatars, a quick account switcher, and so on.  If you're familiar with xFAQs, this is essentially the new version of it after the original creator left gamefaqs.  Other similar extensions you may have heard of / used are Gameweasel and gamefox, both of which are no longer maintained and may stop working as the site updates.  So why not switch over?

# Install instructions

Since xFAQs-Next is a userscript, first you will need an extension that allows you to install userscripts.  Firefox users should get [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/), Chrome users should get [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en).  Other browsers, I'm not sure what the extension is called but a quick google search should find something.  Unfortunately I don't think it will work with any version of IE, if you're using that.

Once you have that extension installed, just click [here](https://github.com/N-eil/xFAQs-Next/raw/master/xFAQs-Next.user.js), which should bring up a page asking to confirm installation.  Say yes, and you're done.  Nice and simple.  The script will update automatically when new features are added, so you won't need to worry about constantly checking back for changes.

# Usage

After installing the userscript, there will be a link to the settings page added to the top right of every gamefaqs page, beside the link to your user profile.  Features start off disabled, so make sure to take a look at the settings page and enable the ones you want to use!



If you have any difficulties installing the script, questions to ask, comments to make, etc, stop by the [help board](http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/565885-).
